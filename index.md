# [FOSDEM 23 - Emulator Development Room CFP](https://lists.fosdem.org/pipermail/fosdem/2022q4/003428.html)
The Call for papers for the FOSDEM emulator development room is hereby open!

At long last, the upcoming FOSDEM 23 will once again take place **IRL** at the [Universit√© libre de Bruxelles, Belgium](https://fosdem.org/2023/practical/transportation/).

[That being said, FOSDEM 23 does provide the option to pre-record talks (similar to FOSDEM 21/22) which might be nice for the speakers that can't attend in person.](https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM23)

### What is FOSDEM?
~~Stolen~~/Borrowed from the website:

_**FOSDEM is a free event for software developers to meet, share ideas and collaborate.**
Every year, thousands of developers of free and open source software from all over the world gather at the event in Brussels._ 


#### Important stuff:
- FOSDEM is free to attend. There is no registration.
- [FOSDEM website](https://fosdem.org/)
- [FOSDEM code of conduct](https://fosdem.org/2023/practical/conduct/)
- [Emulator devroom schedule](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/emulator_development/)

### Desirable topics
Really **anything** goes, but here are some ideas (for inspiration):
- Console emulator development
- Computer emulator development
- Hardware on hardware emulation
- OS emulation development
- Virtual Machine development
- Emulation history
- ...

#### Desirable speakers
We honestly don't care. Experienced speakers are very welcome, but hobbyists and/or first time speakers are equally welcome. As long as you have passion and/or knowledge you care to share.

### How to submit your proposal
To submit a talk, please visit the [FOSDEM 2023 Pentabarf website](https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM23) (we are all but certain that pentabarf has something to do with the 5th dimension üçé).

Create an **event** and click on **Show all** in the top right corner to display the full form.

### What should be in your submission
- name
- short bio
- contact info
- title (funny titles are ~~required~~/appreciated)
- abstract (what you're gonna talk about)
- duration

### Important Dates
- **December 15th: submission deadline**
  - FAQ - is the submission deadline final?
    - Technically speaking, you can submit talks till pentabarf closes, which should be somewhere in January
    - However, talks submitted before the 16th get a higher precedence
- ASAP: announcement selected talks
- February 5th: FOSDEM!
